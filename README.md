# EmbryoTimecourse2018
This repo contains data and analysis scripts for our Embryo Timecourse paper. 
There are two types of content here: scripts to get the processed data (`download`), and scripts that we have used to do our analyses (`analysis_scripts`).

To use the download script, please ensure you have `curl` installed, and run the download script in the `download` folder. You can choose which of our datasets you would like to download while running the script.
